# Service Node

[todo add node image]

With this node you can create a [Service](../services.md). This service will be attached to the [kernel prefab](../uframe-kernel.md). In the _Handlers_ section of the node you can specify [Commands](../commands.md) and [Events](../events.md) that this Service will be subscribed to. You can then implement handlers in the Service class.
