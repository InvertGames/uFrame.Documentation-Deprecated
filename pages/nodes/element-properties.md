# Element Properties

Properties are like C# class properties but more powerfull. When changed, they can invoke [State Machine](reactive-state-machine-node.md) transitions, [Computed Properties](computed-property-node.md) and any other method that is subscribed to them (read more in the [Code section](#code)).

You can select the property type from a list:

or you can drag another element, [Type Reference](type-reference-node.md) or [StateMachine](reactive-state-machine-node.md) to use its type:

Linking a property to a view can make it a [Scene Property](../scene-properties.md).
